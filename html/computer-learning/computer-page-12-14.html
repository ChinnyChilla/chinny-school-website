    <h1> My terrible journey on figuring out how to route a website</h1>

            <h2>Node.js routing is harder than expected </h2>
            <p> So today i try to switch from manually having to make each URL like /computer-learning or /kenimatics-calculator,
                but today I decide I don't want to do that and changed it so it can do it for me.

            <h3> Little did I know, that was a terrible idea</h3>
            <br>
            <p>So in order to do this, i would need to check for every HTML file on this website, which is easy with the simple filesystem.readfolder</p>
            <h4> Problem 1!!</h4>
            <p>There was no way for me to confirm that whatever was in that folder was another folder, html page, javascript, 
                or css file, so i had to install a filter, took like 20 minutes of pain</p>
            <h4>Problem 2</h4>
            <p>filesystem.readfolder turns files into a list, so like i had a list inside a list inside another list</p>
            <h4> Problem 3</h4>
        </div>
        <div id=solution>
            <br>
            <h3>So how do you fix this? By taking way too long and making it way more complicated than it should</h3>

            <p>I dont know why but that took forver to complete</p>
            <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/YQXZrBm/temporary.png" alt="temporary" border="0"></a>
            <p>This just shows that I didn't write much code as to get rid of a bunch of other code that messed up my code
                With only 49 lines of code added and 250 lines of code deleted.
